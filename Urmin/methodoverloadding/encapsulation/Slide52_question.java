		//No, you cannot use the this keyword in a static method in Java. "this" keyword is only applicable for non static method.
		
		2) How can you differentiate with Local and Global Variables , with same name, in Static method. ?
		 The difference between static global variables and static local
		variables is that a static global variable can be accessed from anywhere inside the program while
		a static local variable can be accessed only where its scope exists (i.e block scope).
